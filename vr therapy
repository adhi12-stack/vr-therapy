# 🌍 VR Trauma Therapy – Healing Through Immersive Technology

**A Google Solution Challenge 2025 Project**

## 🧠 About the Project

This project uses **Virtual Reality (VR)** combined with **AI** to support trauma therapy for **refugees and war-affected individuals**. Our goal is to provide a safe, immersive environment that helps users manage stress, anxiety, and trauma in a calming, culturally sensitive way.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Millions of refugees worldwide experience PTSD, anxiety, and emotional distress with limited access to mental health services. Traditional therapy is often unavailable, expensive, or culturally mismatched.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

We are building a VR-based mental wellness tool that:

- 🧘‍♀️ Places users in **safe, peaceful virtual environments**
- 🎧 Uses calming audio, guided breathing, and ambient nature sounds
- 🧠 Integrates an **AI companion** that provides emotional check-ins and supportive dialogue
- 🔁 Offers reusable, low-bandwidth sessions for use in camps or remote areas
